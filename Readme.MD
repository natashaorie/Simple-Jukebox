Project Overview: Simple Jukebox

This is a simple jukebox-type system that plays 3 songs and has visual displays corresponding to the music. The jukebox possesses various button functions such as song selection, skipping songs, and stopping songs. The jukebox consists of an LCD screen, buttons, a speaker, and an ATMega1284. AVRStudio 7 software was used to program the microcontroller, with code being written in C. The visual display takes place on the LCD screen. A series of '*' stars lights up and down in the form of a flowing bar, to correspond with the notes that are being played.

User Guide:

The jukebox will open with a welcome screen. Press the button to proceed and view the song list. 

Once the button is pressed, an instruction page will appear, directing the user to press the button once they see a song title they would like to hear.

The LCD screen will then scroll through the various songs it knows, until the user selects one to play.

Once a song is selected, it will begin to play. The song title will be visible on the top row of the LCD screen, while the visual effects take place on the bottom. 

At any time while the song is playing, the user may press the button once to stop the music and go back to the welcome screen. They may also hold down the button, which will skip through the songs (in the order they were listed) and commence playing the next one.

After the song completes playing, the LCD will return to the welcome screen.
